                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 roasted eggplants</li>
                    <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Parsley</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Peel the roasted eggplants and place them in a large mixing bowl. Mash them with a fork or a potato masher until smooth but slightly chunky for texture.</li>
                    <li>Mince the garlic and mix it into the mashed eggplants. Add olive oil, a pinch of salt, and finely chopped parsley. Stir thoroughly until all the ingredients are well incorporated and the flavors are evenly distributed.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the Baba Ganoush to a serving dish. Drizzle with a little extra olive oil on top for added flavor and a glossy finish. Sprinkle with more chopped parsley or your favorite toppings like paprika or pomegranate seeds. Serve with warm pita bread, crackers, or fresh vegetables.</li>
                </ol>
