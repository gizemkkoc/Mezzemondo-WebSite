               <ul>
                   <li>200g fish roe</li>
                   <li>1 slice stale bread</li>
                   <li>1/2 onion</li>
                   <li>Lemon juice</li>
                   <li>Olive oil</li>
               </ul>
               <h2>Instructions:</h2>
               <ol>
                <li>Take a slice of stale bread and soak it in water for a few minutes until it softens. Squeeze out the excess water and crumble the bread into small pieces.</li>
                <li>In a blender or food processor, combine the fish roe, crumbled bread, and finely chopped onion. Blend until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</li>
                <li>Gradually add lemon juice to the mixture and continue blending. While blending, slowly drizzle in olive oil, allowing it to emulsify and create a creamy consistency. Add olive oil until the desired texture is reached.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust the flavors, adding more lemon juice for tanginess or a pinch of salt if needed. Serve in a bowl, garnished with a drizzle of olive oil, fresh parsley, or a sprinkle of paprika. Enjoy with warm pita bread, crackers, or fresh vegetables.</li>
            </ol>
