                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Ciao! I'm Ayşe Yılmaz, a Turkish chef bringing the flavors of my homeland to the heart of Italy. With 20 years of culinary passion, I’ve reimagined traditional Turkish and Middle Eastern mezzes with a modern twist, blending timeless recipes with the rich, vibrant spirit of Italian culture.</p>
                
                <p>My love for cooking began in my grandmother’s cozy Anatolian kitchen, where the scent of fresh herbs and spices filled the air. In 2016, I followed my dreams to Italy and started this blog to share the authentic recipes I cherish. Encouraged by the incredible support and growing curiosity for Turkish cuisine, I opened a small mezze shop in a quaint corner of Florence in 2019. Today, I’m proud to serve our handcrafted mezzes to food lovers, combining tradition, passion, and a touch of la dolce vita.</p>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Every mezze we create tells a story—a story of tradition, family, and the vibrant culture of Turkey. For us, food is a bridge between cultures, connecting the heart of Anatolia to the elegance of Tuscany. When you visit us, you’re not just tasting food; you’re experiencing the legacy of generations passed down through flavors and aromas.</p>
                
                <p>We are committed to using only the finest ingredients, sourced with care. Our olive oil comes from the sunny groves of Ayvalik, our spices from handpicked Anatolian suppliers, and our fresh vegetables from local Italian farmers, creating a perfect harmony of Turkish tradition and Italian freshness.</p>
