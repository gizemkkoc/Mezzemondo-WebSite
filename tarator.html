               <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
               <ul>
                   <li>2 slices stale bread</li>
                   <li>1 cup walnuts</li>
                   <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
                   <li>Olive oil</li>
                   <li>Salt</li>
               </ul>
               <h2>Instructions:</h2>
               <ol>
                <li>Take two slices of stale bread and remove the crusts. Soak them in a bowl of water for a few minutes until they become soft. Once softened, squeeze the bread gently to remove excess water and crumble it into a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Place the soaked bread, walnuts, and peeled garlic cloves into a mortar and pestle or a food processor. Begin mashing or blending the mixture until it forms a coarse, paste-like texture. Be sure to scrape down the sides occasionally to ensure everything is well combined.</li>
                <li>Gradually drizzle olive oil into the mixture, adding a little at a time. Stir or blend as you go, allowing the olive oil to emulsify with the bread and walnut paste. Continue until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy, adjusting the olive oil quantity based on your desired consistency.</li>
                <li>Season the tarator with a pinch of salt to enhance the flavors. Stir thoroughly to ensure the seasoning is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</li>
                <li>Transfer the tarator to a serving bowl. Drizzle a bit of extra olive oil on top for a glossy finish. If desired, garnish with a handful of chopped walnuts, a sprinkle of paprika, or a few sprigs of parsley for added flavor and presentation.</li>
                <li>Serve the tarator with freshly sliced vegetables, crispy bread, crackers, or as a complementary side dish to grilled meats, seafood, or roasted vegetables. Enjoy this creamy, nutty dip as part of a delicious meal!</li>
